Project Name: AI Flight Delay Prediction

Description:
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict flight delays based on historical flight, airline, and airport data. By analyzing patterns and trends, the system helps airlines and passengers anticipate delays, optimize scheduling, and improve overall travel planning.

Key Features:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering on historical flight datasets

Predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks)

Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and RMSE metrics

Streamlit-based interactive UI for users to input flight details and get real-time delay predictions

Visualizations showing delay trends, airline punctuality, and airport performance

Objective:
Demonstrates the application of AI in real-world business scenarios, combining data analysis, predictive modeling, and interactive dashboards for end-users.

Streamlit for interactive dashboards

Data visualization libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
